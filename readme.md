An attempt to fix bugs in the HORI Flight Stick 2 driver I found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMg44JA4CBw

FS2 folder contains the actual driver solution  
The Test folder contains a compiled and test signed driver

I'm unsure what the purpose of the solutions in the other FS2* folders is, as they arent required to create a functional driver
