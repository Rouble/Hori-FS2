An attempt to fix bugs in the HORI Flight Stick 2 driver I found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMg44JA4CBw

FS2 folder contains the actual driver solution  
The Test folder contains a compiled and test signed driver

The other folders contain a custom USB game controller configuration UI and a program to save and load configs for the flight stick
